# Introduction to OpenCV python

## Images 🎑

- Images are simply numpy arrays.

- These array contain numbers that indicate the color/brightness of the images in different channels.

## Videos 🎥

- Videos are simply a collection of images which are sequentially swapped at some speed (let's say 30 fps, i.e., 30 images per second), and give illusion of a video.

## Some notes 📝

- PyTorch reads image in (C, H, W) - channel, height, width
- OpenCV reads image in (H, W, C) - height, width, channel
- Pytorch reads image in (RGB) channel
- OpenCV reads image in (BGR) channel
